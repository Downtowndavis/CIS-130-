    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      <p>My hobbies mainly consist of playing with my dog, playing video games, and when this pandemic ends I will go back to working out. I mainly play games that are co-op and my favorite one would have to be Deep Rock Galactic. My dog's name is Nyla and she is a German Shepherd/Terrier mix. I have been married for about a year now and like to spend time with my wife when she is not busy studying.</p>
