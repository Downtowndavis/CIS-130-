          <p>Corey joined the business around 2011 when he graduated high school. His father may be the boss, but he did not get any special treatment. He started from the bottom as a laborer and has worked hard enough to put himself into a management position. Corey still travels all over the country to help his crew build and is especially skilled in Drywall Construction. Corey plans to work for Shamrock for the long haul and to make it a company known across the nation for one that focuses on quality and not on how much money they can squeeze out of you.</p>
